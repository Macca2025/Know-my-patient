## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Critical Blockers
1. **No Clinical Safety Officer appointed** - Cannot proceed to production
2. **Database indexes not applied** - Performance risk
3. **No penetration testing** - Security risk
4. **No backup restoration test** - Data loss risk
5. **No uptime monitoring** - Cannot detect outages

### High Risks
1. **H-007 (Stale Data)** - Not yet mitigated, risk score 9
2. **User training not developed** - Users unprepared for go-live
3. **DSPT not completed** - Regulatory requirement
4. **No disaster recovery test** - Unknown RTO/RPO
