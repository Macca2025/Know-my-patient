## 3. Clinical Hazard Log

### 3.1 Critical Hazards

#### H-001: Wrong Patient Record Displayed
**Hazard:** User sees another patient's medical information  
**Cause:** Session management failure, UID verification bypass, or database query error  
**Clinical Risk:** **CRITICAL**
- Wrong treatment based on incorrect information
- Privacy breach (GDPR violation)
- Loss of patient trust

**Severity:** 5 (Catastrophic)  
**Likelihood:** 2 (Unlikely)  
**Risk Score:** 10 (CRITICAL)

**Mitigations Implemented:**
```php
// ✅ Every patient data query includes user_id verification
$stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("
    SELECT * FROM patient_profiles 
    WHERE uid = ? AND user_id = ?
");
$stmt->execute([$patientUid, $currentUserId]);

// ✅ Session validation on every request
if (!$this->sessionService->isLoggedIn()) {
    return $response->withStatus(302)->withHeader('Location', '/login');
}

// ✅ Role-based access control
if (!$this->sessionService->hasRole(['healthcare_worker', 'nhs_user'])) {
    return $response->withStatus(403); // Forbidden
}
```

**Residual Risk:** 2 (LOW) - Multiple layers of protection

---

#### H-002: Data Entry Error - Incorrect Medical Information
**Hazard:** Healthcare worker enters wrong medication/allergy/condition  
**Cause:** Typing error, misclick, copy-paste error  
**Clinical Risk:** **HIGH**

use Respect\Validation\Validator as v;

$medicationValidator = v::stringType()->length(2, 200)->notEmpty();
if (!$medicationValidator->validate($medication)) {
    throw new ValidationException('Invalid medication name');
}

// ✅ Audit logging of all changes
$this->auditService->log([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'activity_type' => 'PATIENT_DATA_MODIFIED',
    'description' => "Modified medication: {$medication}",
    'before_value' => $oldMedication,
